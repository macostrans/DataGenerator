Project:
 Requirement: create an api that spits out random number of data points based on given input. Ex. If I give 5 it should return 5 random data points(limit it to 200 data points per request).
 tools: Python, Fast API, Faker, AWS, Docker, docker swarm, bash, ubuntu, Anaconda.
 Plan: 
  Step1: create python script and test fast API locally with docker
  Step2: Test using dockerfile/docker stack
  step3: create 3 small nodes in aws
  step4: deploy using docker swarm and ensure equal distribution of api calls across nodes
 Bonus: 
  1. Deploy healthcheck
  2. Try update and rollback
  3. Set up versioning and devops.

Roadblocks faced in step 1:
ERROR: No matching distribution found for uvicorn==0.18.0
Unable to access the api even though I already mapped ports.
ImportError: cannot import name 'NoReturn' when I try to run uvicorn.
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement anyio<5,>=3.4.0
Internal service error when I hit /employeeDetails/{total} because it recognizes total as string. 

Learnings and links for step1:
Bind your app inside Docker to 0.0.0.0, not to 127.0.0.1 address to let Docker reach the app inside container.

Used path with parameter types(total: int) inside the def functions.
Use the right or latest stable versions of python images or install it yourself on top of ubuntu images.
Use requirments.txt file to install dependencies.
update pip inside images
